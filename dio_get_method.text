//In order to make a GET request in Flutter using the Dio library, you can use the Dio.get method. Here's an example of how to use it:


import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

Dio dio = Dio();

try {
  Response response = await dio.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
  print(response.data);
} catch (e) {
  print(e);
}
//In this example, the dio.get method is used to send a GET request to the specified URL ("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"). The await keyword is used to wait for the response, which is then stored in the response variable. The response.data property contains the JSON data returned by the API.

//You can also add query parameters to your request by passing a Map to the queryParameters property of the options map.


try {
  Response response = await dio.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", queryParameters: { "id": 1 });
  print(response.data);
} catch (e) {
  print(e);
}
//You can also add custom headers to your requests by passing a Map to the headers property of the options map, for example:


try {
  Response response = await dio.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", 
  options: Options(headers: {
        "Authorization": "Bearer my_access_token",
        "custom_header_name": "custom_header_value"
  }));
  print(response.data);
} catch (e) {
  print(e);
}
It is a good practice to also handle the errors in case something went wrong with the request, 
for example the url is not correct or the api is down, by using the catch statement like in 
the examples above.
